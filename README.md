Hello Developers! This is all about the project Library Management System based on Harry Potter Theme developed in Netbeans using JFrames (java) and Database (MySQL).

Maintaining the book exchange data of the library and keeping it's record is time consuming process and labour intensive work. Solving it with the help of a Program can release the stress of tallying the books and paperworks everyday before closing the library. This automated system needs only small user input to come operational effectively. This software can arrange the books according to the authors, title and categories. This can become easy in searching a particular book quickly. 

A Beginner's level of java project is fully functional and can be implemented in any platform just by installing local server for local database and software. 
There's no doubt that advancement of this project can be made. It's more to time consuming to develop such secure server with student authentication and many more.

To run this project on your system, make sure to follow these steps:

Step 0: Install jdk latest package and setup the environment and java IDE as well (I've used NetBeans here)

Step 1: Download this entire project into your system

Step 2: Create a Database and to access it, Use MySQL (I've used sqlite) [You can use Xampp/phpmyadmin/or access local database with terminal] 

Step 3: Load all the java files located in $PATH/src folder into the IDE

Step 4: Add provided jar files carefully into the IDE 

Step 5: Make sure every background image path's defined in element's icon else have to locate every img file individually for each design element.

Step 6: Now make sure to give a check to javaconnect that it's working (check for the suitable database path location provided in [jdbc:sqlite:"PATH/database_name.(db/sqlite)"])

Step 7: Run the program


Always welcome "New ideas" folks!
